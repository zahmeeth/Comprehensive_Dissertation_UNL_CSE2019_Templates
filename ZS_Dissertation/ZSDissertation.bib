  abstract = {Abstract. We propose timed (finite) automata to model the behavior
	of realtime systems over time. Our definition provides a simple,
	and yet powerful, way to annotate state-transition graphs with timing
	constraints using finitely many realvalued clocks. A timed automaton
	accepts timed words--- infinite sequences in which a real-valued
	time of occurrence is associated with each symbol. We study timed
	automata from the perspective of formal language theory: we consider
	closure properties, decision problems, and subclasses. We consider
	both nondeterministic and deterministic transition structures, and
	both Buchi and Muller acceptance conditions. We show that nondeterministic
	timed automata are closed under union and intersection, but not under
	complementation, whereas deterministic timed Muller automata are
	closed under all Boolean operations. The main construction of the
	paper is an (PSPACE) algorithm for checking the emptiness of the
	language of a (nondeterministic) timed automaton. We also prove that
	the universality problem and the language inclusion problem are solvable
	only for the deterministic automata: both problems are undecidable
	(\Pi 1 1-hard) in the nondeterministic case and PSPACEcomplete in
	the deterministic case. Finally, we discuss the application of this
	theory to automatic verification of real-time requirements of finite-state
	systems.}

	nanomachines to communicate using molecules as a carrier. Controlled
	molecule delivery between two nanomachines is one of the most important
	challenges which must be addressed to enable the molecular communication.
	Therefore, it is essential to develop an information theoretical
	approach to find out molecule delivery capacity of the molecular
	channel. In this paper, we develop an information theoretical approach
	for capacity of a molecular channel between two nanomachines. We
	first introduce a molecular communication model. Then, using the
	principles of mass action kinetics we give a molecule delivery model
	for the molecular communication between two nanomachines called as
	Transmitter Nanomachine (TN) and Receiver Nanomachine (RN). Then,
	we derive a closed form expression for capacity of the channel between
	TN and RN. Numerical results show that selecting appropriate molecular
	communication parameters such as temperature of environment, concentration
	of emitted molecules, distance between nanomachines and duration
	of molecule emission, it can be possible to achieve maximum capacity
	for the molecular communication channel between two nanomachines.},

  abstract = {Olfaction is the dominant sensory modality for most animals and chemosensory
	communication is particularly well developed in many mammals. Our
	understanding of this form of communication has grown rapidly over
	the last ten years since the identification of the first olfactory
	receptor genes. The subsequent cloning of genes for rodent vomeronasal
	receptors, which are important in pheromone detection, has revealed
	an unexpected diversity of around 250 receptors belonging to two
	structurally different classes. This review will focus on the chemical
	nature of mammalian pheromones and the complementary roles of the
	main olfactory system and vomeronasal system in mediating pheromonal
	responses. Recent studies using genetically modified mice and electrophysiological
	recordings have highlighted the complexities of chemosensory communication
	via the vomeronasal system and the role of this system in handling
	information about sex and genetic identity. Although the vomeronasal
	organ is often regarded as only a pheromone detector, evidence is
	emerging that suggests it might respond to a much broader variety
	of chemosignals.}

	dense and efficient distributed operation. This paper examines these
	potential benefits from the perspective of using individual nanotubes
	within random carbon nanotube networks (CNT) to carry information.
	One may imagine small CNT networks with functionalized nanotubes
	sensing multiple elements inserted into a cell in vivo. The information
	from each nanotube sensor can be fused within the network. This is
	clearly distinct from traditional, potentially less efficient, approaches
	of using CNT networks to construct transistors. The CNT network and
	routing of information is an integral part of the physical layer.
	Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) are modeled as linear tubes
	positioned in two dimensions via central coordinates with a specified
	angle. A network graph is extracted from the layout of the tubes
	and the ability to route information at the level of individual nanotubes
	is considered. The impact of random tube characteristics, such as
	location and angle, upon the corresponding network graph and its
	impacts are examined},

	of a new computational paradigm, which we call ant system (AS). We

	The main characteristics of this model are positive feedback, distributed
	computation, and the use of a constructive greedy heuristic. Positive
	feedback accounts for rapid discovery of good solutions, distributed
	computation avoids premature convergence, and the greedy heuristic
	helps find acceptable solutions in the early stages of the search
	process. We apply the proposed methodology to the classical traveling
	salesman problem (TSP), and report simulation results. We also discuss
	parameter selection and the early setups of the model, and compare
	it with tabu search and simulated annealing using TSP. To demonstrate
	the robustness of the approach, we show how the ant system (AS) can
	be applied to other optimization problems like the asymmetric traveling
	salesman, the quadratic assignment and the job-shop scheduling. Finally
	we discuss the salient characteristics-global data structure revision,
	distributed communication and probabilistic transitions of the AS},

	with discrete probability distributions, is a modelling formalism
	suitable for describing formally both nondeterministic and probabilistic

	probabilistic timed temporal logic properties. However, the previously
	developed verification algorithms either suffer from high complexity,
	give only approximate results, or are restricted to a limited class
	of properties. In the case of classical (non-probabilistic) timed
	automata it has been shown that for a large class of real-time verification
	problems correctness can be established using an integral model of
	time (digital clocks) as opposed to a dense model of time. Based
	on these results we address the question of under what conditions
	digital clocks are sufficient for the performance analysis of probabilistic
	timed automata and show that this reduction is possible for an important
	class of systems and properties including probabilistic reachability
	and expected reachability. We demonstrate the utility of this approach
	by applying the method to the performance analysis of three probabilistic
	real-time protocols: the dynamic configuration protocol for IPv4

	switches residing in either of two different stable states. MAPK
	cascades are often embedded in positive feedback loops, which are
	considered to be a prerequisite for bistable behavior. Here we demonstrate
	that in the absence of any imposed feedback regulation, bistability
	and hysteresis can arise solely from a distributive kinetic mechanism
	of the two-site MAPK phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Importantly,
	the reported kinetic properties of the kinase (MEK) and phosphatase
	(MKP3) of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) fulfill the
	essential requirements for generating a bistable switch at a single
	MAPK cascade level. Likewise, a cycle where multisite phosphorylations
	are performed by different kinases, but dephosphorylation reactions
	are catalyzed by the same phosphatase, can also exhibit bistability
	and hysteresis. Hence, bistability induced by multisite covalent
	modification may be a widespread mechanism of the control of protein

	the propagation of molecular signals through a line of patterned
	HeLa cells expressing gap junction channels (HeLa Cx43 cells). The

	with lithography and surface chemical treatment. Lucifer Yellow was
	first used as a fluorescent marker to demonstrate the formation of
	functional gap junction channels between patterned HeLa Cx43 cells.
	The cells at one end of the cell line were next chemically stimulated
	to induce the propagation of intercellular calcium waves along the
	cell line, which was successfully monitored with Fluo4. The designed
	microplatform allowed intercellular communication over an arbitrary
	network topology of cells, which may provide new insight into mechanisms
